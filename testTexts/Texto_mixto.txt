Atlantic Strike is a periodic series of combined,
joint exercises conducted under the auspices of the U.S.
Air Force's Air Combat Command. The exercise focuses on close
air support functions where ground controllers direct air strikes
on moving and stationary ground targets.

The exercise is conducted at Avon Park Air Force Range in central
 Florida. The 2010 exercise was conducted in September and included
 aircraft and ground teams from the US Army, Air Force and Marine Corps
 as well as soldiers from Canada and Slovenia. Actual and simulated air
 strikes by B-52 bombers, A-10 close-support aircraft and attack helicopters
 were conducted. The 2011 exercise was also conducted at Avon AF Range,

   (joint terminal attack controllers) and U.S. Marine Corps.
